# star-search
Star Search is a React app that gives information on characters, spaceships, and planets from Star Wars. <br />
Publication on my GitHub: https://slowreactiontime.github.io/star-search/ <br />

# What I Learned

* Developed interactive and navigatable app using React's State and Lifecycle.
* Integrated the Star Wars API to display info on Star Wars' characters, spaceships, and planets.
* Implemented some animations with packages such as react-particles-js.
* Customized appearance by using tachyons and overwriting their CSS.
* Uses of functions to manipulate states and improve readability. 

# Note

* The Star Wars API that I used: https://swapi.co/
* I used images under the conditions of Fair Use (for educational purpose and self-amusement :sunglasses:). If you need some of the images taken down for whatever the reason, just contact me.
