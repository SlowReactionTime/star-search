# star-search
Star Search is a React app that gives information on characters, spaceships, and planets from Star Wars. <br />
Publication on my GitHub: https://slowreactiontime.github.io/star-search/ <br />

# What I Learned

* Developed interactive and navigatable app using React's State and Lifecycle.
* Integrated the Star Wars API to display info on Star Wars' characters, spaceships, and planets.
* Implemented some animations with packages such as react-particles-js.
* Customized appearance by using tachyons and overwriting their CSS.
* Uses of functions to manipulate states and improve readability. 

# Note

* ~~The Star Wars API that I used: https://swapi.co/~~ (SW API migrated, so this app was updated accordingly as of 6/5/2021. For more info: https://swapi.dev/about)
* ***This API seems to frequenly rearrange IDs and characters/ships/planets. Cards and displayed info may mismatch in future's updates.***
* Using images under the conditions of Fair Use (for educational purpose and self-amusement :sunglasses:).
